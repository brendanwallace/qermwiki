## About

This is the (empty) repo attached to the wiki for
[QERM](https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/degree-programs/)
students at the University of Washington.


### Why a github wiki

We considered three options:

  1. static pages on github
  2. github wiki
  3. standing up a media wiki (or similar) on a wiki farm

Ultimately we decided static pages on github would make the learning curve
to start collaboratively editing too high (everyone needs to become a collaborator
on the repo and edit via git), and standing up a media wiki could easily prove
hard to maintain over the long term. A github wiki seemed like the easiest solution
that we could get started on right away, and also the best thing to leave to
future QERM students.
